**Java Refresher – From Beginner to Advanced** ☕

📌 **About**

This repository contains my practice code while following a 12-hour Java course (Beginner to Advanced) on YouTube.
The repo is for refreshing my Java knowledge: revisiting the fundamentals, practicing OOP, exploring advanced features, and building small projects.

🎯 **Learning Focus**

- Java fundamentals (variables, operators, control flow)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): classes, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction
- Data structures: arrays, ArrayLists, HashMaps, generics
- File handling & exception management
- Multithreading & concurrency basics
- Mini-projects to apply concepts in practice
